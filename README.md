# 🚀 AI Explore

**Visualize LLM Streams & Data in Real-Time.**

AI Explore is a modern Next.js application designed to bring raw LLM outputs to life. It captures streaming text and code from a `.jsonl` dump, simulates a real-time server connection, and magically extracts & renders **Vega-Lite** charts dynamically as they appear in the conversation.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Core Intelligence
*   **Real-time Emulation**: Simulates a live Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream from a static dump file.
*   **Dynamic Parsing**: Intelligently detects and renders generic text alongside complex Vega-Lite chart specifications.

### 🎨 Dual Interface Modes
Switch instantly between two powerful views:

1.  **📊 Dashboard Mode** (Classic)
    *   A professional, split-pane layout.
    *   Perfect for debugging and analyzing raw data vs. visual output side-by-side.

2.  **💬 Chat Bot Mode** (Modern)
    *   A sleek, conversational interface inspired by tools like ChatGPT.
    *   **Immersive Visuals**: Charts appear *inside* the chat bubbles, seamlessly integrated with the text.
    *   **Smart Controls**: Playback controls are tucked away at the bottom, just like a chat input bar.

### 🎛️ Full Control
*   **Playback**: Play, Pause, and Replay the stream at will.
*   **Speed Board**: A dedicated control center to speed up (up to 5x) or slow down the stream to analyze details.
*   **Mobile Ready**: Fully responsive design that feels native on phones and tablets.
